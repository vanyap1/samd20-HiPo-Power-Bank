#define LEN				0	//Alert Latch Enable; configures the latching feature of the Alert pin and Alert Flag bits.
/*
1 = Latch enabled
0 = Transparent (default)
When the Alert Latch Enable bit is set to Transparent mode, the Alert pin and Flag bit resets to the idle states when
the fault has been cleared. When the Alert Latch Enable bit is set to Latch mode, the Alert pin and Alert Flag bit
remains active following a fault until the Mask/Enable Register has been read.

/*
This bit is set to '1' if an arithmetic operation resulted in an overflow error. It indicates that current and power data
may be invalid.
*/
#define CVRF			3	//Conversion Ready Flag
/*
Although the device can be read at any time, and the data from the last conversion is available, the Conversion
Ready Flag bit is provided to help coordinate one-shot or triggered conversions. The Conversion Ready Flag bit is
set after all conversions, averaging, and multiplications are complete. Conversion Ready Flag bit clears under the
following conditions:
1.) Writing to the Configuration Register (except for Power-Down selection)
2.) Reading the Mask/Enable Register
*/
#define AFF				4	//Alert Function Flag
/*
While only one Alert Function can be monitored at the Alert pin at a time, the Conversion Ready can also be
enabled to assert the Alert pin. Reading the Alert Function Flag following an alert allows the user to determine if the
Alert Function was the source of the Alert.
When the Alert Latch Enable bit is set to Latch mode, the Alert Function Flag bit clears only when the Mask/Enable
Register is read. When the Alert Latch Enable bit is set to Transparent mode, the Alert Function Flag bit is cleared
following the next conversion that does not result in an Alert condition.
*/
#define CNVR			10	//Conversion Ready
/*
Setting this bit high configures the Alert pin to be asserted when the Conversion Ready Flag, Bit 3, is asserted
indicating that the device is ready for the next conversion.
*/
#define POL				11	//Power Over-Limit
/*
Setting this bit high configures the Alert pin to be asserted if the Power calculation made following a bus voltage
measurement exceeds the value programmed in the Alert Limit Register.
*/
#define BUL				12	//Bus Voltage Under-Voltage
/*
Setting this bit high configures the Alert pin to be asserted if the bus voltage measurement following a conversion
drops below the value programmed in the Alert Limit Register.
*/
#define BOL				13	//Bus Voltage Over-Voltage
/*
Setting this bit high configures the Alert pin to be asserted if the bus voltage measurement following a conversion
exceeds the value programmed in the Alert Limit Register.
*/

/*
Setting this bit high configures the Alert pin to be asserted if the shunt voltage measurement following a conversion
drops below the value programmed in the Alert Limit Register.
*/
#define SOL				15	//Shunt Voltage Over-Voltage
/*
Setting this bit high configures the Alert pin to be asserted if the shunt voltage measurement following a conversion
exceeds the value programmed in the Alert Limit Register.
